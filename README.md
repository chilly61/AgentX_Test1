This is a copy of agentbeats tutorial: https://github.com/agentbeats/tutorial
Docker images could be seen in packages: agentx_judge (ghcr.io/chilly61/agentx_judge:v1.0) & agentx_debator (ghcr.io/chilly61/agentx_debater:v1.0). Actually I can not perform the docker due to Gemini key settings. Just to test how to upload the file in the competition.
